This repository studies the optimization methods for the Vecchia approximation with a penalty function.

## Optimization methods
Four optimizations methods are discuessed:

1. Fisher scoring
2. Quadratic approximation combined with coordinate descent 
3. L-BFGS-B method
4. Forward selection

## First experiment

Simulate GP with: 

* n = 10,000
* kernel = Matern2.5
* sigma = 1, tau2 = 0.05^2, d = 20 with r = (10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0, 0, ...)

For the first three optimization methods, search the penalty parameter lambda on a grid. For forward selection, need to decide the criteria for selecting the best model at each step and the criteria for variable selection to stop. The criteria can be based on:

* Loglikelihood
* Cross-validated MSE
